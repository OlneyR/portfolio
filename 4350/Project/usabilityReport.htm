	<h1>Usability Report:</h1><br>
	<h1>Scope</h1>
	<p>General aesthetics and navigation around the content.</p>
	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>Navigation doesn't (to me) seem difficult, and I had already planned on replacing the large image (which obscured the purpose of the site, but looked pretty okay)</p>
	<h1>Participants</h1>
	<p>Tara Jones and Athena.</p>
	<h1>Scenarios</h1>
	<p>User was instructed to locate 1)the gallery of wood products and 2)the testimonials page. Both participants found the locations with ease.</p>
