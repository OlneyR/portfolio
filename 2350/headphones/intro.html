			<p>The purpose of this site is to present you with a basic understanding of headphones types and provide some recommendations when shopping for them. These recommendations are mainly based upon a combination of personal experience and miscellaneous recommendations I have heard. Because of this, some of the recommendations are hearsay so I recommend further investigation before purchase.
			</p>
			<p>Compared to listening to speakers, headphones in general allow for easier listening combined with lower outside noise. Compared to spearkers headphones also provide a level of privacy to what is being listened to, which eliminates disturbance to others. Another advantage over speakers is portability, headphones are lightweight and, in the case of in-ear headphones especially, can fit in a pocket easily. In the case of over-ear headphones they can be easily carried on the back of the neck.
			</p>
			<p>The technology used in headphones varies not only in their construction shape but with additions to the functionality of the headphones. Two of the most noticable options in this regard are noise cancelling and wireless or bluetooth transmitter headphones.
