			<p>Wireless headphones come in many forms, though nearly all at over-ear shaped. This type can either be connected to a stationary emitter or a portable one, both using usually bluetooth to communicate (though older ones may use a different frequency.) The benefit of the stationary emitter is a larger range from the emitter, because of a wall-socket power source for the emitter. The portable bluetooth emitter would have to have a battery separate from the audio player, so to extend battery life listening range is lowered. The only downside, besides usually a higher price, for wireless headphones is a slightly lower bitrate of the audio being transmitted, due to the transfer rate of bluetooth.

			<p>Noise cancelling headphones are also nearly all over-ear form. The effect they produce is a muting -nearly completely- of any consistant outside noise. They wouldn't remove the sound of a single voice, but the sound of an engine or a crowd noticably lowered. Like the wireless type, these are also a bit more expensive than regular headphones, and also require a separate battery source than the audio player's (at least for the cancelling to function.) These headphones are perfect for air travel because the eliminate the loud engine noise from aircraft, which (in my experience) makes it much easier to sleep.
