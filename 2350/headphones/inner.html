			<p>In-ear headphones can be categorized in generally two ways, earbuds and in-ear monitors (or IEMs.) In-ear monitors are often referred to as earbuds when sold because of widespread familiarity with the term 'earbuds,' leading to confusion. IEMs insulate signifigantly more outside noise than earbuds, and usually use removable plastic attachments to allow for better fitting into the ear (which increases sound isolation and general comfort.)
			</p>
			<p>Earbuds, alternatively, are generally cheaper than IEMs. They fit into the ear using a slightly shaped body that houses the internal speaker, with the only insulation being often only a mostly-hollow plastic shell. The headphones that apple includes with all their devices are of this category, and are possibly the worst of them all (I have no experience with their new version, though.) Besides poor audio isolation and variable quality in this category, they are likely to cause the most discomfort of all headphones because of the hard-shelled, often-oversized form of the earbuds.
