			<p>Over-ear headphones main advantage over in-ear is sound quality. Because of the increased capacity in size, over-ear headphones can be built with higher quality internal speakers which allow for, potentially, a higher and lower frequency range and clearer sound in general. I say potentially because the phrase "you get what you pay for" often describes headphones, besides certain brands that are well known for being overpriced.
			</p>
			<p>The main disadvantage found with the large over-ear headphone category, besides size and portability, is the discomfort that long periods of listening result in. If the headphones stop airflow (to insulate the sound) or use large amounts of padding ears become hot over time. Another problems is when the headphones are too tight. Even slight pressure holding the headphones onto the head, after a few hours, can result in more-than-expected discomfort.
			</p>
			<p>Over-ear headphones are generally thought of as the type that joins over the head, but also includes the variety that attach behind the head. These type are the middle ground in utility of the headphone types. Although their quality is limited, they can provide a middle ground between the materials of an over-ear and the portability of an in-ear.
