			Ereaders
        </h1>
        <p>Ereaders are portable devices used for reading books, magazines, or newspapers (hence the name.) The defining feature that separates ereaders from just being tablets is the E-ink type screen, which allows for long battery life and is supposed to be less damaging to the eyes after long periods of reading.</p>
        <p>The ereader has multiple benefits over its alternatives (reading print or reading off of normal portable device screens.) The advantage over regular print is the ereader's capacity and features, allowing a reader to carry dozens of books at once and recall progress for each automatically. Against regular screens the ereader's advantage is the before-mentioned eyestrain relief, along with a lack of distractions that a tablet is capable of providing. Also, because E-ink screens mainly use power for changing pages, the ereader is often capable of battery life between two to four weeks.</p>
        <p>The main drawbacks of ereaders are tradeoffs compared to it's alternatives. Longtime book readers sometime dislike ereaders because of their familiarity with physical print. The tradeoff against tablets is functionality, ereaders use a slow-refreshing black and white screen, which makes internet browsing difficult, and many ereaders have avoided having browsers altogether. Tablets can play music, movies, games, browse the internet, and much more. This results in the tradeoff, something good to read with against something good at many, many other things.</p>
