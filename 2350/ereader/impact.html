          	<li>Access to personal library of books.</li>
            <li>Less eyestrain compared to reading on normal screens.</li>
            <li>Ebooks are often cheaper than their physical counterparts.</li>
        </ul>
      	<p>The advantage of capacity is one of the major features of ereaders. Against physical books the use of digital format allows many more books to be carried at any one time. The number of books is only limited by the size of the internal storage of an ereader. They often contain storage for four to eight gigabytes of files, and because an entire book is mere kilobytes in size, ereaders can potentially carry hundreds of books at a time. Many ereaders include some form of wireless connection, either wifi or 3G, to enable downloading books at any time. This enables synchronizing with a personal library locally by wifi, or increasing the size of your library by purchasing books from a store of some kind.</p>
        <p>Compared to a regular LCD screen (or retina, if you care what apple calls their LCD screens) electronic paper screens are most comfortable for reading text for long periods of time. This is because e-paper functions by switching between black and white on an unlit, matte screen. This allows reading as though off of paper. Another obstacle LCD screens have is glare, the glass covering LCD screens use creates visual problems in bright light (glare, reflection, comparative dimness.) When viewed in bright light the ereader is easily read, in fact more easily than in normal lighting. The only weakness ereaders have with visibility is the lack of built-in light (for low light conditions), which some ereaders have made up for by back- or side-lighting their screens.</p>
        <p>Only observing the amazon book-selling market, the price for an ebook is usually at or up to a third lower than the physical edition. Exceptions occur when a paperback edition is printed at high enough numbers to drive it's price down to match, or sometimes beat the ebook. Outside of amazon's business, though, are a multitude of sites that provide free books legally due to expired copyright. Another benefit of using the free sources, such as Project Gutenburg, are the lack of DRM formats in the ebooks. This allows you to have actual control over the files, which is important if you want to share them with friends or use them on multiple devices or back them up in case of hard drive failure.</p>
