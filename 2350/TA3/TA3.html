        		<h1>Ereaders</h1>
        		<p>Ereaders are portable devices used for reading books, magazines, or newspapers (hence the name.) The defining feature that separates ereaders from just being tablets is the E-ink type screen, which allows for long battery life and is supposed to be less damaging to the eyes after long periods of reading.</p>
                <p>Some consider any portable device capable of presenting an ebook a ereader, making smartphones and tablets (and possibly even laptops) fall into the category. In general, however, the title of ereader in normal use is saved for E-ink screens.
                </p>
        		<p>The ereader has multiple benefits over its alternatives (reading print or reading off of normal portable device screens.) The advantage over regular print is the ereader's capacity and features, allowing a reader to carry dozens of books at once and recall progress for each automatically. Against regular screens the ereader's advantage is the before-mentioned eyestrain relief, along with a lack of distractions that a tablet is capable of providing. Also, because E-ink screens mainly use power for changing pages, the ereader is often capable of battery life between two to four weeks.</p>
        		<p>The main drawbacks of ereaders are tradeoffs compared to it's alternatives. Longtime book readers sometime dislike ereaders because of their familiarity with physical print. The tradeoff against tablets is functionality, ereaders use a slow-refreshing black and white screen, which makes internet browsing difficult, and many ereaders have avoided having browsers altogether. Tablets can play music, movies, games, browse the internet, and much more. This results in the tradeoff, something good to read with against something good at many, many other things.</p>

    		<ul>
    			<li><p id="pros">
        		A major advantage of ereaders is storage capacity. Compared to books, an ereader can contain dozens, or even hundreds of texts. Considering this advantage the ereader's light weight is relevant as well, because if compared even to certain single novels the ereader is lighter and more portable. 
        		</p></li>
        		<li><p id="cons">
        		The largest disadvantage ereaders have has to do with visibility. The lack of a built-in light (for low light conditions) makes viewing the screen difficult, which some ereaders have made up for by back- or side-lighting their screens.
